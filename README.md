handyMaps is THE map for all things Cal Poly.

The app was created with the initial goal of being a map app for disabled students, but throughout development we realized that this was a stretch goal that would not be accomplished within the timframe of the class due to the constraints imposed upon us i.e. MVC.

The app is able to store schedules so you can route on the fly to whatever classes you currently are enrolled to.

Uses MAPBOX API and JSON parser to read the data to help us accomplish our goals. Android Studio was the environment used to develop the app.
